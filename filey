To practice merge command
Editing filey inside branch3_sgp
Adding this line on master branch to check if it still reflects in branch4
Adding this line on branch4 to check if it'sa 3way merge or a conflict

Conflict can occur only in 3 way merge but not in Fast forward merge.
Conflict can occur only if same file is modified (by adding new lines/deleting) in both branches,
conflict may not occur if new files are added? Needs checking in future exercise
